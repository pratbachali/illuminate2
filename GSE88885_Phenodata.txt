Gene expression measured in blood sample from SLE subject at week52 with LY 120 mg Q4W treatment	"HTA2.0 microarray pre-processing was performed. Probe level microarray data were summarized to two different levels, ""gene"" level and ""exon-group"" level. In both cases, the first two steps of the pre-processing were standard background correction and quantile normalization, as done in standard robust multi-array average (22). For the ""gene"" level analyses, data were then summarized by the sample effect estimated by robust regression (rlm function in the R MASS package) from a two-way ANOVA model with probe and sample effects. For the ""exon-group"" analysis (presented in the corresponding data matrix table), data were first summarized to the probeset level (as defined by Affymetrix) and low-expression probesets were filtered out as follows. An expression score was constructed for each probeset by computing the 80th percentile across all samples; probesets whose expression score was below the 95th percentile of the intronic normalization control probesets (normgene->intron) were discarded. The filtered probesets within a ""transcript cluster"" were then grouped using hierarchical clustering to form exon groups using the R hclust function. The distance metric between two probesets was defined as one minus the correlation of the pair. Probe level data were then summarized for each ""exon-group"" (cluster) using robust estimates of the sample effects as done in the ""gene"" level summarization."
